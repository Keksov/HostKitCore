# HostKitCore

Shared shell and build kit for the hosts of the KKMindWave workspace (MindWave today, Gnauralcity
next). Layering: hosts -> modules (`GnauralCore`, `BodyMonitorCore`) -> HostKitCore. HostKitCore
knows no product: it never imports a host or a module, and the list of hosts lives in the
workspace registry `hosts.json` (workspace root), not here.

It receives what a host gives its modules today, in a generalized form (plan `gnauralcity`,
decisions GCY-D2, GCY-D29, GCY-D17 in `MindWaveCore/docs/gnauralcity/gnauralcity-plan.md`):

- `@panel` and `@tooltip` — the aliases keep their names, only their target moves here
  (step GCY1.3);
- the ws transport with module registration, the module registry and app assembly (routes, panels,
  i18n), the detached-panel page and route (GCY1.4);
- shell services and the bare layout: connection banner, "Bun actions", language (GCY1.5);
- the host UI factory: quasar config and a base tsconfig with one pinned copy of shared libraries
  (GCY1.6);
- the server skeleton: start-up, routing by module, admin endpoints, shutdown chain, HTTP and
  loopback utilities (GCY1.7).

Until those steps land this repository holds no code: each part arrives by its own move step, with
its tests and its verify steps.
